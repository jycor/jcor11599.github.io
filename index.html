<p id="job-title"> Software Enginnering Intern at Lytx, June 2020 - August 2020 <p>
<p> 
    I was a Software Engineering Intern at Lytx Inc. over the summer of 2020.
    Over the summer, I was fortunate enough to work as part of an Agile development team on both the front and the back end of Lytx's administrative website;
    the webpage allowed customers to organize, track, and manage their drivers.
    On the front end, I worked with Angular and Typescript to fix various cosmetic and usability issues.
    On the backend, I worked on migrating a legacy API from .NET Core framework to .NET Core + OpenShift.

<p id="job-title">CSE Tutor at UCSD, September 2018 - now</p>
<p>
  I have been a tutor for Professor Paul Cao in a variety of courses:
  <ul>
    <li> CSE 8B: Introduction to Java and Object Oriented Programming
    <li> CSE 11: Introduction to Java (Accelerated)
    <li> CSE 12: Introduction to Data Structures
    <li> CSE 30: Computer Organization and Systems Programming
    <li> CSE 100: Advanced Data Structures
  </ul>
  As a tutor, my primary goal is to encourage and bolster student learning.
  I host lab hours, in which I assist students with debugging their code, reinforce topics and concepts taught in lectures, etc.
  I assist in the creation and testing of programming assignments for students.
  Additionally, I have hosted discussion sections and developed.
  Lastly, I have worked on the Autograder, a grading script meant to automatically evaluate and provide feedback on student's code on Gradescope.

<p id="job-title">Robotics Camp Instructor at SDSC, August 2019 - August 2019</p>
<p>
  I was a teacher for a week.
  Professor Cao offered me the posistion of holding a week-long class for international students.
  The goal of the class was to introduce students to programming using a block-based programming language and Adafruit's Circuit Playground Express.
  Each day student would create increasingly difficult projects, and improve their logical problem solving skills.
  Students were able to explore and work with many different sensors (accelerometer, microphone, brightness) and output forms (lighting colored LEDs, controlling servos, and playing tones) in creating projects like the Hot Potato game, Muirland's Egg, and creating their own safe.

<p id="job-title">Teaching Assistant and Program Specialist at Digital Media Academy, July 2019 - August 2019</p>
<p>
  I taught high school kids about Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Machine Learning. <br>
  I was also in charge of planning fun activities during breaks for the younger students.
</p>

<p id="job-title">ITS Computer Assistant at UCSD, September 2018 - February 2020</p>
<p>
  I resolved I was tasked with dealing with plenty of tickets (requests) for a variety of issues.
  From general software/driver issues to setting up and imaging computers for othere employees,
  I'm constantly learning on the job and dealing with different issues each day.
  More importantly, working in the IT department has helped me become more resourceful and creative problem solver.
